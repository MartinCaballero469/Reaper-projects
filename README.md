## [Projects](https://github.com/MartinCaballero469/Reaper-projects/tree/main/projects)

- Under [Projects](https://github.com/MartinCaballero469/Reaper-projects/tree/main/projects) I will have all of my individual Reaper folder projects, including the original tracks and the frozen version, with FX added, and also a ```/renders``` folder of the tracks for easier access and editing. I got the info to do this in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCqjbtgiU1Q) by Reaper tutorials

- in each project folder, I will add a ```[Project name].md``` file that will include info such as
  - fx plugins used in the projects
  - links to YouTube music videos, Spotify, or Reddit post discussions related to the project
  - Instruments used on the project
